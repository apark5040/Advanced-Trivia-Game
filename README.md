# Advanced-Trivia-Game

This is similar to the other trivia game that I have, except the code was changed slightly to make it where each questions are timed. 

Once the start button is pressed, user has 10 secs to select an answer. Once the 10 secs passes, the game will tell you if the answer is right or wrong then moves on to the next question shortly after. 

There are only 3 questions. 

I'm not exactly too proud of this code because I tried experimenting a lot, and I ended up with a jumble of code. 

I will add comments to these later.
